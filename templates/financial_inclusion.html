      <p class="lead text-muted">
        Financial inclusion ensures that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs—transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance—delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. It's a key enabler for reducing poverty and boosting prosperity.

  <!-- Importance of Financial Inclusion -->
  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="fw-bold">Why Financial Inclusion Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Access to financial services empowers individuals to manage their finances, invest in education, health, and businesses, and cushion against economic shocks. For small and medium enterprises (SMEs), it facilitates growth and job creation. At a macro level, financial inclusion contributes to economic development and stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The World Bank emphasizes that financial inclusion is a catalyst for achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including eradicating poverty, promoting economic growth, and reducing inequalities.
